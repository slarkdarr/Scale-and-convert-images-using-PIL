Module 1 Project of Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
# Introduction
My company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! I'm not able to get in contact with the designers and my own deadline is approaching fast. I need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

# What I'll do
Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

+ Open an image

+ Rotate an image

+ Resize an image

+ Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory
